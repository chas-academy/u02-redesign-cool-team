# VSCode Settings
We use SASS in this project and use Live Sass Compiler by Ritwick Dey to compile SASS code into normal CSS for browsers to undrestand.
 - Settings I use and I recommend you guys to use it. Otherwise your compiled files are stored in another folder.
 1. In left bottom corner click on Gear icon and then click on Settings
 2. in Settings page on the right top corner of the page, you see three icons, mouse over them, one of them says "Open Settings (JSON)"
 3. Paste the code in there.
 ```sh
"liveSassCompile.settings.generateMap": false,
  "liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
    {
      "format": "expanded",
      "extensionName": ".css",
      "savePath": "/assets/css"
    }
  ],
```
